We evaluate candidates based on three criteria:

- Technical ability (as demonstrated in the take home and final round)
- Customer service orientation (as this role is customer facing)
- Alignment with our values (captured [here](https://www.notion.so/qawolf/QA-Wolf-QA-Engineer-Remote-156203a1e476459ea5e6ffca972d0efe))

This means whether we hire you is based on how you do during our interview process, not on your previous experience (or lack thereof). Note that you will also need to pass a background check to work here as our customers require this.
